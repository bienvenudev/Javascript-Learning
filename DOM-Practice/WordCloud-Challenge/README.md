# DOM Practice - Word Cloud Challenge

The file **cloud.html** contains a paragraph of text.

In this paragraph, find the 12 most often occurring words, and put them in a word cloud below the paragraph.

If you do not know what a word cloud is, here is an example:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6f49f27-a252-499a-96e2-c9a268a030f3)

The most often occurring word should have a font size of 64px. The second most often occurring word should have a font size of 60px. The third most often occurring word should have a font size of 56px. And so on, down to the 12th most often occurring word with a font size of 20px.

Other stylings are completely up to you! Colors, arrangement, how the words are flipped - that's your decision.

You may edit **cloud.html**, **cloud.js**, and **cloud.css**.

- **cloud.html**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

    <h2>Exercise 1 - Word Cloud</h2>

    <p id="myParagraph">The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For
        science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their
        pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one
        could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar,
        pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is
        more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and
        regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be
        Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine
        told me what Occidental is. The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a
        myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their
